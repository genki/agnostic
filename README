Agnostic
========

For FW hackers
--------------

* configure plugin by application developer

  Agnostic.plugin :plugin_name do
    # do configure
    config_entry value
  end

* load helpers

  include Agnostic::Helper


For Plugin providors
------------------

* access to configuration entry

  Agnostic.plugin(:plugin_name).config_entry

* register a view helper

  Agnostic.helpers do
    def your_view_helper
    end
  end

For Application Developers
--------------------------

If your FW support agnostic, you need to do nothing.
Otherwise, you should initialize angostic by

  require "agnostic/polyglot"

at your FW's configuration script (such as config/environemnt.rb).
